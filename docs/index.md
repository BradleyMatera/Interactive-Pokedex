# Project Documentation

Welcome to the Interactive Pokédex documentation. This folder now stores reference material for the project rather than the static build output used for GitHub Pages.

## Contents

- `architecture.md` – Deep dive into the runtime/data model (providers, static generation, and routing).
- `deployment.md` – How we build, export, and publish to GitHub Pages (including trailing-slash verification).
- `deployment-debugging-legacy-cache.md` – Postmortem for the legacy service-worker cache incident and mitigation steps.

If you add additional documents, update this index so collaborators can find them easily.
