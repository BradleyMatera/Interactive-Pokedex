# Project Documentation

Welcome to the Interactive Pokédex documentation. This folder now stores reference material for the project rather than the static build output used for GitHub Pages.

## Contents

- `deployment.md` – Details on how the GitHub Pages workflow publishes the exported site.
- `architecture.md` – High-level overview of the Next.js application structure.

If you add additional documents, update this index so collaborators can find them easily.
